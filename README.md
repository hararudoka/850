# 850 basic words in 4 languages

Goal of this project is to provide a basic words of each language. You can use it to create REST API or use on your device offline (it is just JSON file and some useful methods to work with it in Go).

Actually, I was need to learn some words from foreign languages. I found some apps, but I didn't like them. So, I decided to create my solution for this problem.
